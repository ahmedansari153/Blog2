			Oculus Pricing Issue
			</h3>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>
			The Oculus Rifts price has finally been revealed, and instead of the $350 everyone was hoping for, we are getting it for $600! In an attempt to calm fans and backers, Oculus took to reddit where they did an "Ask Me Anything" and answered tough questions from everyone. The man behind the AMA took responsibility for any pricing assumptions taken.

			<h3>
			The hype is dead: Will Destiny be able to revitalize it's fanbase.
			</h3>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>
			Destiny has been a success so far. However it has been riddled with issues since day one. The fanbase is tired of seeing and experiencing problems with the game, and they will ultimately start experiencing a loss of playerbase. Will they be able to keep the players active with community events, or is the decision for no DLC till Hearthfire a good idea. Personally I believe Destiny is not going to last very long at it's current rate. Sparrow Racing was fun but the content just wasn't enough to keep some people who were done with all the main content from staying. PVP has taken a loss since the last patch. Compared to when Destiny launched TTK is just not nearly the same. The way PVP is in it's current state is not competitive enough, and will also continue to make people quit. As an experienced player who has played since beta, I'm very dissapointed with the turn PVP took. Hand cannons are still awful. Hawkmoon took a huge un needed nerf. We will find out in time what is needed for Destiny to continue.

			<h3>
			HTC Sales Down 35%: What happened?
			</h3>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>
			Looks like HTC had a really bad last year. There smartphone sales went down 35% and they have no one else to blame but themselves. They didn't want to change and it hit them where it hurt. They weren't listening to customers and weren't revolutionizing. There was once a time when they were the face of android, but not anymore. They have been plagued with a bad camera, bad software, and a lack of good incremental updates.
